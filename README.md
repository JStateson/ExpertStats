# Expert and Volunteer Performance statistics

## Data collected since January 1, 2024

All data was collected from public forums only

Note that not all volunteers were active during that interval.

Kudos given for solutions were ignored in the All Posts chart.

Four charts providing statistics are in a zip file

WorkShedule: 10 to 11 months showing a solution date

KudoChart: Shows kudos from OPs and Peers

MonthsThroughput:  Shows the completions done monthly

UserPosts: Shows the total volunteer posts: Solved, Kudo'ed and No Response.
   Data was scaled to %100 and normalized for days worked.

The zip and the application require 7z and a password
